        <p class="des">The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Sources cite at least 118
            identified
            "Egyptian" pyramids.[1][2] Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now located in
            the
            modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt, most were built as tombs for the country's
            pharaohs
            and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]

            The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one
            step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has
            been
            attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the
            period,
            suggesting there may have been others.[6] The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built
            c.
            2630–2610 BCE during the Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered
            to
            be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[8]

            The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza
            pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[9] The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest
            Egyptian
            pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence, despite its being
            the
            oldest wonder by about 2,000 years.</p>

        <p class="desc">
            The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a
            human, and the body of a lion.[1] Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the
            west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx appears to represent the pharaoh Khafre.[2]

            The original shape of the Sphinx was cut from the bedrock, and has since been restored with layers of
            limestone blocks.[3] It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the
            top of the head and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.[4] Its nose was broken off for unknown reasons
            between the 3rd and 10th centuries AD.

            The Sphinx is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and one of the most recognisable statues in the
            world. The archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom
            during the reign of Khafre

        <h1 class="sim">ABU SIMBEL TEMPLE</h1>
        <p class="desco">
            Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel (Arabic:
            أبو سمبل), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. It is situated on the western bank of
            Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The complex is part
            of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments",[1] which run from Abu Simbel downriver to
            Philae (near Aswan), and include Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, and other Nubian sites. The twin temples were
            originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the
            Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king Ramesses II. His wife Nefertari and
            children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet, considered to be of lesser importance and were not
            given the same position of scale. This commemorates his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external
            rock relief figures have become iconic.

            The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz
            Michałowski, from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw,[2] on an artificial
            hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was
            necessary or they would have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water
            reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the River Nile. The project was carried out as
            part of the UNESCO Nubian Salvage Campaign

        <h1 class="queen">QUEEN HATSHEPSUT TEMPLE</h1>
        <p class="descoo">
            The mortuary temple of Hatshepsut (Egyptian: Ḏsr-ḏsrw meaning "Holy of Holies") is a mortuary temple built
            during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.[b] Located opposite the city of
            Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture.[c] Its three massive terraces rise
            above the desert floor and into the cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. Her tomb, KV20, lies inside the same massif
            capped by El Qurn, a pyramid for her mortuary complex. At the edge of the desert, 1 km (0.62 mi) east,
            connected to the complex by a causeway lies the accompanying valley temple. Across the river Nile, the whole
            structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon, Hatshepsut's most recognizable addition to the Temple
            of Karnak and the site from which the procession of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley departed. The
            temple's twin functions are identified by its axes: its main east-west axis served to receive the barque of
            Amun-Re at the climax of the festival, while its north-south axis represented the life cycle of the pharaoh
            from coronation to rebirth.

            Construction of the terraced temple took place between Hatshepsut's seventh and twentieth regnal year,
            during which building plans were repeatedly modified. In its design it was heavily influenced by the Temple
            of Mentuhotep II of the Eleventh Dynasty built six centuries earlier.[d] In the arrangement of its chambers
            and sanctuaries, though, the temple is wholly unique. The main axis, normally reserved for the mortuary
            complex, is occupied instead by the sanctuary of the barque of Amun-Re, with the mortuary cult being
            displaced south to form the auxiliary axis with the solar cult complex to the north. Separated from the main
            sanctuary are shrines to Hathor and Anubis which lie on the middle terrace. The porticoes that front the
            terrace here host the most notable reliefs of the temple. Those of the expedition to the Land of Punt and of
            the divine birth of Hatshepsut, the backbone of her case to rightfully occupy the throne as a member of the
            royal family and as godly progeny. Below, the lowest terrace leads to the causeway and out to the valley
            temple.

            The state of the temple has suffered over time. Two decades after Hatshepsut's death, under the direction of
            Thutmose III, references to her rule were erased, usurped or obliterated. The campaign was intense but
            brief, quelled after two years when Amenhotep II was enthroned. The reasons behind the proscription remain a
            mystery. A personal grudge appears unlikely as Thutmose III had waited twenty years to act. Perhaps the
            concept of a female king was anathema to ancient Egyptian society or a dynastic dispute between the Ahmosid
            and Thutmosid lineages needed resolving. In the Amarna Period the temple was incurred upon again when
            Akhenaten ordered the images of Egyptian gods, particularly those of Amun, to be erased. These damages were
            repaired subsequently under Tutankhamun, Horemheb and Ramesses II. An earthquake in the Third Intermediate
            Period caused further harm. During the Ptolemaic period the sanctuary of Amun was restructured and a new
            portico built at its entrance. A Coptic monastery of Saint Phoibammon was built between the 6th and 8th
            centuries AD and images of Christ were painted over original reliefs. The latest graffito left is dated to
            c. 1223.

            The temple resurfaces in the records of the modern era in 1737 with Richard Pococke, a British traveller,
            who visited the site. Several visitations followed, though serious excavation was not conducted until the
            1850s and 60s under Auguste Mariette. The temple was fully excavated between 1893 and 1906 during an
            expedition of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) directed by Édouard Naville. Further efforts were carried out
            by Herbert E. Winlock and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MMA) from 1911 to 1936, and by Émile Baraize and
            the Egyptian Antiquities Service (now the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA)) from 1925 to 1952. Since
            1961, the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology (PCMA) has carried out extensive consolidation and
            restoration works throughout the temple.
